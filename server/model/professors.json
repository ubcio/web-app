Ron set up a very friendly casual learning environment, remembered 150+ student names, and was just an all around great teacher. I'd like to leave some constructive criticism but I took the course a few terms ago and I can't remember a single thing I disliked about Ron's teaching. Occasionally parts of the course itself bugged me but it was not all in Ron's control. I would highly recommend to anyone to take a class with Ron",
